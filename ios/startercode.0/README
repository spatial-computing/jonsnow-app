ANSWERS TO ASSIGNMENT README QUESTIONS (if applicable):

2.The probability of two heads, one head and one tail and two tails are 25%, 50% and 25%. Because 
P(one head and one tail)=0.5*0.5*2=0.5.

3.Tossing the coin about 2000 times can get the result within 1% of these probability.

4.you can do 2147483647 times trials before it crashes with an overflow error. I tried 2147483647,
it still worked, but 2147483648 crashed the simulator.
